Based on your training results and production deployment considerations, here's a comprehensive comparison and recommendation:

## **Model Performance Comparison**

### **1. Logistic Regression with TF-IDF**
- **Accuracy**: 99.76%
- **Weighted F1-Score**: 99.76%
- **Model Size**: ~2MB (vectorizer + model)
- **Inference Time**: <1ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: Low (~50MB RAM)

### **2. LightGBM**
- **Accuracy**: 98.59%
- **Weighted F1-Score**: 98.59%
- **Model Size**: ~5MB
- **Inference Time**: <2ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: Low (~100MB RAM)

### **3. DistilBERT (Fine-tuned)**
- **Accuracy**: 100% (Perfect)
- **Weighted F1-Score**: 100%
- **Model Size**: ~268MB
- **Inference Time**: 50-100ms per prediction
- **Memory Usage**: High (1-2GB RAM)

## **Production Deployment Recommendation**

### **Primary Choice: Hybrid Deployment Strategy**

**For High-Value Sales Interactions:**
- **Use DistilBERT** - The 100% accuracy justifies the computational cost for critical customer communications[1][2]
- Best for: Enterprise clients, high-value deals, complex sentiment analysis

**For High-Volume/Real-Time Processing:**
- **Use Logistic Regression** - Near-perfect performance (99.76%) with minimal latency[3][4]
- Best for: Bulk email processing, real-time notifications, resource-constrained environments

**Fallback Strategy:**
- **Use LightGBM** - Excellent balance of performance and efficiency[5][6]
- Best for: When GPU unavailable but need better context understanding than TF-IDF

## **Why This Hybrid Approach?**

### **Business Impact Considerations** :[7][2]
1. **Cost-Effectiveness**: 99.76% accuracy at 50x lower computational cost for most use cases
2. **Scalability**: Handle thousands of predictions per second with Logistic Regression
3. **Quality Assurance**: Reserve DistilBERT for high-stakes customer interactions

### **Technical Justification** :[1][3]
1. **Latency Requirements**: Sales teams need <100ms response times for real-time use
2. **Infrastructure Costs**: GPU costs $2-5/hour vs CPU at $0.10/hour
3. **Maintenance**: Simpler models require less MLOps overhead

## **Implementation Strategy**

```python
def get_prediction(text, high_priority=False):
    if high_priority and gpu_available:
        return distilbert_predict(text)  # 100% accuracy
    elif cpu_only:
        return logreg_predict(text)      # 99.76% accuracy, <1ms
    else:
        return lightgbm_predict(text)    # 98.59% accuracy, balanced
```

### **Production Deployment Criteria** :[2][4]

**Use DistilBERT when:**
- Customer lifetime value > $50K
- Contract value > $100K
- Complex multi-sentence responses
- Regulatory compliance required

**Use Logistic Regression when:**
- Real-time processing needed
- High-volume batch processing
- Resource-constrained environments
- 99% accuracy sufficient

This approach maximizes both **business value** and **operational efficiency**, ensuring optimal resource allocation while maintaining exceptional performance across different use cases.[6][7]
